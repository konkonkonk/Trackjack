I am redesigning the user interface and the commercial release system. I recently tried using cmus again and I realized their ui is orders of magnitude better than mine.
I'm not going to copy their whole style as trackjack honestly doesn't need to be that modular or scaleable, and I don't feel like making something unoriginal.
However, I do want a filesystem explorer similar to theirs as an alternative to my weird ass com release system.
If I was designing trackjack from scratch now I never would have created that stupid system. I made it because I was a comparatively much worse programmer at the time I started developing it.
It was the easiest way I could think of doing this at the time.



FILE WINDOW:
The new system will list out all audio files in your current directory, instead of a com release.
It will also list ../ at the top to give you the ability to navigate upstream.
Below ../ will be all of the sub-directories in the loaded directory.
I'm going to name this section of the screen the file window.
All of the things it displays will be called filesystem elements. Probably fs_element in code.

The file window will be limited to a specific size both x and y.
If a file's name exceeds the x size, it will spill over to the next line.
If a directory's elements exceed the y size, the list can be scrolled up and down by the user by using the up and down arrows at the top and bottom rows of the file window.



(Both the playback bar and metadata bar should be located under the message box window, so they will have the entire length of the terminal to print to.)

PLAYBACK BAR:
The playback bar lists the timestamp as something like 0:00 / 9:59, and then the name of the file being played.
It will be located immediately below the file window.

METADATA BAR:
The metadata bar will list the album, artist, year, and features.
I might also add entries for a producer credit, and music label, if the metadata contains them.
