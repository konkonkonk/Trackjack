* Playback system outline

** Optimal behavior

1. Automatically play songs continuously in album/playlist
2. Automatically detach and delete buffers after being processed

** Idea

Function to play standalone song.

Function to play a song and load the next in queue.
        Pause previous source, detach and delete buffer, delete source.
        Decode selected song, attach to new source and play.
        Decode next song, queue to the source.


Check if current source has any processed buffers, if so:
        Delete processed buffer.
        Load next song into buffer, and into queue.
