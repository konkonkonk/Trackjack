* Project Overview

Trackjack is a very minimal linux-only terminal based music player.

** Limitations

1. Trackjack cannot decode vorbis audio streams. Opus is untested. I recommend using flac or mp3. This will be fixed soon.

2. Trackjack is also currently incapable of switching audio devices. To create the openAL context in which audio is played, I use the alutInit() function, which is part of the apparently largely deprecated openAL utility toolkit library. This function automatically assumes which device to bind to, and I have not yet implemented a way to change it.

3. Trackjack cannot dynamically resize the window it is running in. If you resize it while the program is running, you will need to restart it to properly fill the terminal.

** Features

1. Play music

2. Navigate file systems

3. Display relevant metadata


** Build instructions

1. Ensure you have the following programs installed: git, gcc, make
2. Ensure you have the following libraries installed: openAL-soft, ncurses, libav

3. Download trackjack's source code and navigate to its folder:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/konkonkonk/trackjack
   cd trackjack
   #+END_SRC

4. To compile:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   make
   #+END_SRC
   To compile and install:
   (IMPORTANT: When you run trackjack this way, it will not be able to navigate to the test home directory packaged in the source code. You will have to load a home directory via a command at runtime, or by editing the init() function in src/trackjack.c before compilation.)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo make install
   #+END_SRC
